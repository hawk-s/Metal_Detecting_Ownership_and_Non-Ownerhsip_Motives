# Metal_Detecting_Ownership_and_Non-Ownerhsip_Motives
Empirical data and source codes for the Bachelor Thesis: 'Metal Detecting Ownership and Non-Ownership Motives'.

To reproduce the analysis please clone this whole repository and run the files 'DATASET_1.py' up to 'DATASET_5.py', in the 'ANALYSIS' folder.
(The analysis code can be also run in probably more user-friendly Jupyter Notebook environment - '.ipynb' files.)

Please make sure to have all the necessary libraries installed.


The key datasets used, available in the 'ANALYSIS' folder, are: 

                           'MAIN_DATA.xlsx'            - used in 'DATASET_1', 'DATASET_3', 'DATASET_4', 'DATASET_5'

                           'df_non_reduced_coins.xlsx' - used in 'DATASET_2'
                           
                           'ancient_artifacts.xlsx'    - used in 'DATASET_5'


Raw codes used for the web scraping of artifacts, coins, and profiles data can be viewed in the 'SCRAPING' folder.

Raw datasets of artifacts and coins obtained via web scraping are available in the 'SCRAPING' folder, in the folder 'raw_scraped_data.
